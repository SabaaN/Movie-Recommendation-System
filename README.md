# Movie-Recommendation-System

This Movie Recommendation System is designed to help users discover new movies based on their interests and preferences. By analyzing the content and metadata of movies, the system provides personalized recommendations by identifying similar movies.
The system employs a content-based filtering approach, which means that it recommends movies based on their similarity to the movies a user has already liked. It analyzes various features such as movie genres, actors, directors, and plot keywords to determine similarity. Vectorization is applied to transform these textual features into numerical representations.
It employs the Streamlit framework for the front end and integrates the TMDB API to fetch movie posters.




It relies on the following dependencies:
Python 3.7+
Streamlit
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Requests

You can clone the repo using the following command:
